   <p> Welcome to my website! <br>
    My name is Brandon, also known as NybiLin! <br>
    I'm starting to code from zero and aim to become a professional developer, this website shall be a showcase of the things I'm learning! <br>
    The design for the home page is still to be determined but in the meantime here's a peek of the projects I finished:  <br>
    </p> 
    <br><br><br>
    <div class="project">
    <h2> My projects</h2>
     <div class="project-list"> <h3> Here is a link to my <a href="Proj1/index.html">first</a> project!</h3>
     <P> This project is a single html page with basic CSS to demonstrate the first skills I obtained.</p>
     <H3>My second project is <a href="Proj2/index.html">here!</a></H3>
    <p>This is a simple tool that generates two passwords by pressing the generate password button using basic javascript.</p>
    <h3>My third project lies <a href="Proj3/index.html">here!</a> </h3>
    <p>This is simple counter made in javascript.</p>
